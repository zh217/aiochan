But these are not too useful (compared to other languages, at least): in python, the danger of threads stepping on each other is so great that the default implementation, CPython, has a global interpreter lock, or GIL, that ensures that only a single python statement can execute at a given instance! Even with such a big fat lock always in place, we still need locks in order to prevent unwanted interleaving! So the GIL prevents us from using multiple processors. Locking has overheads. To make things still worse, python schedules thread execution in a somewhat unintuitive manner which results in favouring slow (or CPU-intensive) operations over fast ones, the opposite of what most operating system does. The end result: python code utilizing threads often runs *slower* than those that do not."
