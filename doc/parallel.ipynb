In addition to file accesses, if you are doing number-crunching, then hopefully you are not doing it in pure python but instead relies on dedicated libraries like numpy, scipy, etc. All of these libraries release the GIL when it makes sense to do so.

However, if you give the argument `immediate_only=True`, then if the operation cannot be completed immediately, it will be queued (but again, the pending queue can overflow). In addition, you can give a callback to the `cb` argument, which will be called when the put finally succeeds, with the same argument as the return value of `await put(v)`. The same is true with `get_nowait(immediate_only=True, cb=cb)`. For `select`, if you give a callback to the `cb` argument, then you should not call `await` on it, but instead rely on the callback being called eventually as `cb(return_value, which_channel)`.

    "\"But why?\" Well, obviously writing callbacks is much harder than using asyncio. But who knows? Maybe you are writing some other, higher-level framework that can make use of the semantics of aiochan. The possibilities are endless! In particular, there are non-asyncio concurrency frameworks in python itself that utilizes the same coroutines, an example being `python-trio`. Since the core of aiochan does not rely on asyncio, porting it to `trio` is trivial."
