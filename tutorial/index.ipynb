Let's say that you have all the things *you* need to do written on a to-do list. Concurrency only means that you do not need to take the first item off the list, do it *and wait for the result*, then start with the second item. Your first item might well be \"watch the news at 9am, then watch the news at 9pm, and find out what new things have happened since 9am\". In this case non-concurrent behaviour means sitting there doing nothing after watching the 9am news until 9pm. As long as you *switch context* and starting doing something after the morning news you are in the realm of concurrent behaviour. Note that *you need neither a group of cronies to whom you can delegate your news watching, nor the rather unusual ability to watch two programs at once and perfectly understanding both, to enable concurrent behaviour*. Having a group of cronies doing stuff for you is a form of *parallelism*. Concurrency *enables* parallelism (it is useless to have many cronies if you need to wait for any one of them to complete their work before assigning work to the next one), but parallelism is not *necessary* for concurrency. Parallelism usually (but not always) makes things go faster. Concurrency can also make things go faster *even without parallelism*. In the case of computers, you *do not* need to have multiple processors to benefit from concurrency (in the case of python, this point is actually quite acute--see later when we discuss the GIL)."

And using global variables in this case is rather convenient: we just take something (input) that is put inside predetermined boxes (global variables), and when we are done, just put them back.

A classical example is that you and your friend both want to operate on two boxes A and B. You go forward and put your sticker on A, meanwhile your friend has already put his sticker on B.

Now this immediately excludes any possibility of utilising multiple process cores *within python itself* (as we will see later, if you step out of python there are ways around it). And locking has overheads. And python schedules thread execution in a somewhat unintuitive manner which results in it often favouring slow (or CPU-intensive) operations over fast ones, which is opposite of what most operating system does.

Still, there are various *patterns* of concurrency programs that occur so often so that we have implemented them as additional functions and methods that you can readily use. None of them is essential, but using the provided *convenience* functions make your code easier to read, especially for others. Let's continue onto the next section!"
